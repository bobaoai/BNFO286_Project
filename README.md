## Ranking with sparse NN

  SNPs' statistic scores are obtained.

  NN is built with following structure:

  SNPs -> Gene -> Weighted Gene -> SNPs

  SNPs are sampled for NN trainning and validation

  The Weighted Gene layer is taken out and the weight is used for gene ranking. Done.

## Ranking with Network Propagation

  Use the top-hitted SNPs pvalue as the gene value.

  Run the GWAB or NetWAS to do the network propagation.
